# Setup

A **development container** is a running container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. You can try out development containers with **[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)** or **[Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)**.

### Devcontainer Setup

1. Install docker and visual studio code, if you haven't already
2. Install the [vscode devcontainer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
3. Either click [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/UserNobody14/ai_agents_cookbooks) to automatically install and open the cookbooks in a new devcontainer, *or* follow the proceeding steps if you want to put them in a more recognizable place.

5. Clone this repository onto your local computer
6. Open up the folder in vscode
7. Press "Ctrl-Shift-P" in vscode, and type "Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen"
8. You should be good!
